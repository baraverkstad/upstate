.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Prints a report containing machine and process metrics. Also checks for the
existence of a number of configured processes. A short output example:
.sp
.nf
    loadavg:  0.06 0.04 0.00             up 264 days * 192 processes * 1 cores
    memory:   64 MB (6.6%) free          491 MB rss * 426 MB cache * 981 MB total
    storage:  16.0 GB (66.6%) free       6.8 GB used * 24.1 GB total * on /

.sp
Information is read from the \fB/proc\fR filesystem or via the
\fBdf\fR, \fBps\fR, \fBpgrep\fR or \fBpstree\fR utilities.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB--summary\fR
.RS 4
Report only a short machine status summary.
.RE
\fB--limited\fR
.RS 4
Report excludes optional/hidden processes.
.RE
\fB--complete\fR
.RS 4
Report includes all processes (default).
.RE
\fB--json\fR
.RS 4
Prints the report in JSON output format.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The processes to check are configured in \fB/etc/upstate.conf\fR or
\fB/usr/local/etc/upstate.conf\fR  with one line per process. Comment or blank
lines are ignored. Each line contains the process or service name, pid file
and an optional command-line argument to match:
.sp
.nf
    cron            /var/run/crond.pid
    sshd            /var/run/sshd.pid
    local           - local-command-match
    -rsyslog        /var/run/rsyslogd.pid
.fi
.sp
Processes with a leading \fB-\fR character in the name are optional. These
are omitted in \fB--limited\fR report and always ignored if missing.

A pid file specified as \fB-\fR forces process lookup by either name or
command-line match. Process lookup is also made in similar way if the pid
file didn't exist or didn't match a running process.
.SH "FILES"
.sp
.B /etc/upstate.conf
.RS 4
Service configuration file with one line per service.
